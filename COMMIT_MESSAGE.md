# Commit: Add credentials helper and unified login flow to landing page

## Summary
Enhanced the landing page login area with a credentials helper and unified the Get Started CTA with the login flow. Both features use the same authentication mechanism and navigate to the dashboard upon successful login.

## Changes Made

### 1. Credentials Helper Component
- **Location**: Added above email input in login form
- **Design**: Subtle pill/box with gray background and border
- **Content**: Displays "admin | password123" in monospace font
- **Functionality**: 
  - Click auto-fills email with "admin" and password with "password123"
  - Focuses password field after auto-fill
  - Keyboard accessible (Enter/Space keys)
  - Tab-focusable with proper focus styles
  - No mouse pointer animations (only subtle hover background)

### 2. Get Started Button Enhancement
- **Behavior**: Now triggers same login flow as Login button
- **Process**: Auto-fills demo credentials and navigates to /dashboard
- **Integration**: Uses shared `performLogin()` function for consistency

### 3. Code Structure Improvements
- **Shared Logic**: Created `performLogin()` function used by both Login and Get Started buttons
- **Navigation**: Added React Router navigation to dashboard
- **State Management**: Enhanced form state handling for auto-fill functionality
- **Accessibility**: Added proper ARIA labels and keyboard event handling

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
- `src/pages/WelcomePage.jsx`: Main implementation
- `src/pages/__tests__/WelcomePage.test.jsx`: Comprehensive test suite

### Key Functions Added
```javascript
// Common login handler for both buttons
const performLogin = (credentials = null) => { ... }

// Get Started button handler
const handleGetStarted = () => { ... }

// Credentials helper handlers
const handleCredentialsHelper = () => { ... }
const handleCredentialsKeyDown = (e) => { ... }
```

### Styling
- Credentials helper: `bg-gray-50 border border-gray-200 rounded-lg px-3 py-2`
- Hover effect: `hover:bg-gray-100` (subtle, no pointer animations)
- Focus styles: `focus:ring-2 focus:ring-purple-500`

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests (WelcomePage.test.jsx)
1. **Credentials Helper Tests**
   - ✅ Displays correct format ("admin | password123")
   - ✅ Auto-fills email and password on click
   - ✅ Focuses password field after auto-fill
   - ✅ Keyboard accessible (Enter/Space keys)
   - ✅ Proper focus styles and tab-focusable

2. **Get Started Button Tests**
   - ✅ Triggers login flow when clicked
   - ✅ Auto-fills credentials and navigates
   - ✅ Uses same navigation as Login button

3. **Login Form Integration Tests**
   - ✅ Submits form with correct credentials
   - ✅ Prevents default and handles programmatically
   - ✅ Navigation works for both manual and auto-filled forms

4. **Accessibility Tests**
   - ✅ Proper ARIA attributes on credentials helper
   - ✅ Form inputs have correct labels and attributes
   - ✅ Keyboard navigation works properly

### Integration Tests
1. **User Flow Testing**
   - Navigate to landing page
   - Click credentials helper → verify auto-fill
   - Click Login button → verify navigation to dashboard
   - Navigate back, click Get Started → verify same behavior

2. **Keyboard Navigation Testing**
   - Tab to credentials helper → verify focus
   - Press Enter/Space → verify auto-fill
   - Tab through form elements → verify proper order
   - Submit form with keyboard → verify navigation

3. **Cross-browser Testing**
   - Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
   - Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)
   - Verify consistent behavior across platforms
